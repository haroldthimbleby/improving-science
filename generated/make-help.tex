\texttt{make all}&
      Download and analyze the data, then typeset the main files (\texttt{paper.pdf}, \texttt{appendix.pdf} and \texttt{all.pdf}) that import all the data, as well as make the self-contained expanded \texttt{.tex} (and \texttt{.PDF}) files that do not depend on the separate data files in \texttt{data/*}.\\
   \multicolumn{1}{l@{\vdots}}{}&\\

\texttt{make data}&
      Analyze the data, and generate all the data files, the Unix scripts, the CSV, and \LaTeX\ files (including the \LaTeX\ summary of this makefile), etc. This \texttt{make} option runs \texttt{node programs/data.js}, downloads the Git repositories used in the pilot survey, and then analyzes them. Note that downloading all the repositories in a reasonable time needs decent internet bandwidth.\\
   \multicolumn{1}{l@{\vdots}}{}&\\

\texttt{make help}&
      Explain how to use \texttt{make}, and list all available options for using it.\\
