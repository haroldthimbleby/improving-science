Latex file details

Paper Latex file is: paper-main-seb.tex

Supplementary material is: paper-seb-supplementary-material.tex

The paper uses comjnl.cls as usual

The file macros.tex defines some auxiliary material

A few other simple macros are defined as needed in the files, in particular for the yellow highlighting of the data access statement in the main paper

The Bibtex file CompJ.bst has been carefully debugged, resulting in the file that is used: revisedCompJ.bst

Note that revisedCompJ.bst performs some new things to format URLs well, etc, and it would not be suitable for wider use (though I'd be happy to prepare an update of CompJ.bst if it'd be helpful)




Some Latex files are input into the paper. These are all in the directory generated/
Please do not edit these files; instead refer to the README file or use make to update the directory files as required.



README.md provides a lot of additional details, including how to use make to generate the paper
